  <h1 class="mb-4 text-4xl font-bold text-pink-100">About PodUptime</h1>

  <p class="mb-4">
    PodUptime is a distributed uptime monitoring system for the podcast industry, measuring
    availability of hosting platforms and tracking prefixes.
  </p>

  <h2
    class="mb-4 mt-6 border-b-2 border-dotted border-pink-100 pb-2 text-2xl font-bold text-pink-100"

    How does it work?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4 [&>code]:underline">
    The measurement process involves regularly conducting an <code>HTTP HEAD</code> request against
    a media enclosure <code>URL</code>, which is typically found in podcast <code>RSS</code> feeds.
    We gather data from various AWS regions, each of which performs an <code>HTTP HEAD</code>
     request every minute on every monitored service. These regions include <code>us-west-1</code>,
    <code>us-east-2</code>, and <code>eu-south-1</code>, carefully chosen to avoid regions where
    most companies typically run their workloads, ensuring an unbiased measurement.
  </p>

  <p class="mb-4 [&>code]:underline">
    The <code>User-Agent</code> being used to perform these requests is:
    <code>Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; PodUptimeBot/1.0; +https://poduptime.com; rid:XXX)</code>. The <code
      >rid</code
    >
     property represents a random GUID (eg: <code>0e7f5251-9d03-4371-8186-a82ca9c5235e</code>) which
    is utilized to persist the request results in our internal database, facilitating debugging
    purposes. Additionally, it ensures that consecutive checks conducted on the same endpoint are
    not treated as originating from the same listener, in accordance with the IAB definition, and
    prevents short-circuiting of a pre-existing cached response.

    How is availability established?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">Availability is established differently based on the type of the target:</p>

  <ul class="mb-4 list-outside list-disc pl-4">
    <li class="pb-3 [&>code]:underline">
      <strong class="font-bold text-pink-100">Tracking prefixes</strong> are considered&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <Status type="UP" />&nbsp;&nbsp;if they promptly redirect to the prefixed <code>URL</code>
       with one of the following <code>HTTP</code> status codes: <code>301</code>, <code>302</code>,


      <code>303</code>, <code>307</code>, or <code>308</code>. The redirection itself is not
      followed, ensuring that the measured duration represents the actual time it takes for the
      prefix to initiate the redirect.
    </li>
    <li class="[&>code]:underline">
      <strong class="font-bold text-pink-100">Hosting platforms</strong> are considered&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <Status type="UP" />&nbsp;&nbsp;if they respond with an <code>HTTP</code>
       status code <code>200</code> to a request made to the monitored URL, following any redirects.
      In this scenario, the measured duration reflects the actual time it takes for the client to
      reach the destination of the <code>HEAD</code> request.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mb-4">
    The status shown in the homepage represent the availability over the last 30 minutes and it is
    reported as follows:
  </p>
  <table class="mb-4">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th class="px-4 py-2">Status</th>
        <th class="px-4 py-2">Availability</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2">
          <Status type="UP" />
        </td>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2"
          >The endpoint consistently showed as &nbsp;
          <Status type="UP" />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2">
          <Status type="PARTIAL" />
        </td>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2"
          >The endpoint was detected as &nbsp;
          <Status type="UP" />&nbsp; in certain regions or moments and as &nbsp;
          <Status type="DOWN" />&nbsp; in others
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2">
          <Status type="DOWN" />
        </td>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2"
          >The endpoint consistently showed as &nbsp;
          <Status type="DOWN" />&nbsp;
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2">
          <Status type="UNKNOWN" />
        </td>
        <td class="border border-dotted px-4 py-2">No data is available for the endpoint</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Furthermore, to minimize false positives and ensure fairness in our measurements, an endpoint is
    classified as &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <Status type="DOWN" />&nbsp;&nbsp; only when two consecutive measurements from the same region
    confirm its status.

    Why is a particular hosting platform / prefix missing?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    It's possible that we may have missed it, or the specific platform might not allow the creation
    of a free account, and we do not have an existing one to use. Please get in touch with us via
    email at poduptime@spreaker.com, and we will do our best to incorporate your chosen platform or
    prefix.
  </p>

  <h2
    class="mb-4 mt-6 border-b-2 border-dotted border-pink-100 pb-2 text-2xl font-bold text-pink-100"

    I see this is made by an hosting platform, is it biased?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Every service we monitor receives equal visibility, and the testing methodology is explained in
    detail. If you find this information insufficient, you can review the source code of the project
    on
    <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/spreaker/poduptime">GitHub</a>. We believe that
    releasing the code as open source addresses any concerns or doubts about fair measurement.
    However, if you still have any questions or require further clarification, please feel free to
    get in touch, and we'll be happy to assist.

    Do you keep a changelog?
  </h2>

  <p class="mb-4">
    Yes, we maintain a <a class="font-normal underline" href="/changelog/">Changelog</a> where you
    can review all the changes that have been implemented in this monitoring system over time.
